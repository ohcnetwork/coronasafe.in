# FAQ

### What is a Corona Virus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome \(MERS\) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome \(SARS\). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

### What are the symptoms of COVID-19 ?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people \(about 80%\) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

### How does COVID-19 spread ?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter \(3 feet\) away from a person who is sick.

> WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

### What can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ?

> You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

* Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
* Maintain at least 1 metre \(3 feet\) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
* Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
* Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
* Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
* Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots \(cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely\). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.

### How likely am I to catch COVID-19 ?

The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world \(cities or areas\) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

### Who is at risk of developing severe illness ? 

While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions \(such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes\) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

### Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19 ?

While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

### Should I wear a mask to protect myself ?

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms \(especially coughing\) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks \(see Advice on the use of masks\).

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter \(3 feet\) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.

### Is there anything I should not do ?

The following measures **ARE NOT effective** against COVID-19 and can be harmful:

* Smoking
* Wearing multiple masks
* Taking antibiotics

In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.
